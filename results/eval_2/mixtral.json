In this case, \"bird\" is the class.\n\nNext, we identify the family of the animal by checking if the keyword is a specific type of animal within the class. For example, \"peacock\" is a type of bird, but \"bird\" is too broad to be considered a family. Instead, \"crane\" is a family of bird, so we categorize \"crane\" as the family.\n\nFinally, we identify the species of the animal by checking if the keyword is a specific subtype of animal within the family. For example, \"Bald eagle\" is a species of bird, but \"bird\" and \"crane\" are too broad to be considered a species. In this case, there is no specific species given, so",
